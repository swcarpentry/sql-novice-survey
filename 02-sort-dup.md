Data is often redundant,
so queries often return redundant information.
For example,
if we select the quantitites that have been measured
from the `survey` table,
we get this:

~~~ {.sql}
select quant from Survey;
~~~

|quant|
|-----|
|rad  |
|sal  |
|rad  |
|sal  |
|rad  |
|sal  |
|temp |
|rad  |
|sal  |
|temp |
|rad  |
|temp |
|sal  |
|rad  |
|sal  |
|temp |
|sal  |
|rad  |
|sal  |
|sal  |
|rad  |

We can eliminate the redundant output
to make the result more readable
by adding the `distinct` keyword
to our query:

~~~ {.sql}
select distinct quant from Survey;
~~~

|quant|
|-----|
|rad  |
|sal  |
|temp |

If we select more than one column --- for example,
both the survey site ID and the quantity measured --- then
the distinct pairs of values are returned:

~~~ {.sql}
select distinct taken, quant from Survey;
~~~

|taken|quant|
|-----|-----|
|619  |rad  |
|619  |sal  |
|622  |rad  |
|622  |sal  |
|734  |rad  |
|734  |sal  |
|734  |temp |
|735  |rad  |
|735  |sal  |
|735  |temp |
|751  |rad  |
|751  |temp |
|751  |sal  |
|752  |rad  |
|752  |sal  |
|752  |temp |
|837  |rad  |
|837  |sal  |
|844  |rad  |

Notice in both cases that duplicates are removed
even if they didn't appear to be adjacent in the database.
Again,
it's important to remember that rows aren't actually ordered:
they're just displayed that way.

As we mentioned earlier,
database records are not stored in any particular order.
This means that query results aren't necessarily sorted,
and even if they are,
we often want to sort them in a different way,
e.g., by the name of the project instead of by the name of the scientist.
We can do this in SQL by adding an `order by` clause to our query:

~~~ {.sql}
select * from Person order by ident;
~~~

|ident  |personal |family  |
|-------|---------|--------|
|danfort|Frank    |Danforth|
|dyer   |William  |Dyer    |
|lake   |Anderson |Lake    |
|pb     |Frank    |Pabodie |
|roe    |Valentina|Roerich |

By default,
results are sorted in ascending order
(i.e.,
from least to greatest).
We can sort in the opposite order using `desc` (for "descending"):

~~~ {.sql}
select * from person order by ident desc;
~~~

|ident  |personal |family  |
|-------|---------|--------|
|roe    |Valentina|Roerich |
|pb     |Frank    |Pabodie |
|lake   |Anderson |Lake    |
|dyer   |William  |Dyer    |
|danfort|Frank    |Danforth|

(And if we want to make it clear that we're sorting in ascending order,
we can use `asc` instead of `desc`.)
  
We can also sort on several fields at once.
For example,
this query sorts results first in ascending order by `taken`,
and then in descending order by `person`
within each group of equal `taken` values:

~~~ {.sql}
select taken, person from Survey order by taken asc, person desc;
~~~

|taken|person|
|-----|------|
|619  |dyer  |
|619  |dyer  |
|622  |dyer  |
|622  |dyer  |
|734  |pb    |
|734  |pb    |
|734  |lake  |
|735  |pb    |
|735  |-null-|
|735  |-null-|
|751  |pb    |
|751  |pb    |
|751  |lake  |
|752  |roe   |
|752  |lake  |
|752  |lake  |
|752  |lake  |
|837  |roe   |
|837  |lake  |
|837  |lake  |
|844  |roe   |

This is easier to understand if we also remove duplicates:

~~~ {.sql}
select distinct taken, person from Survey order by taken asc, person desc;
~~~

|taken|person|
|-----|------|
|619  |dyer  |
|622  |dyer  |
|734  |pb    |
|734  |lake  |
|735  |pb    |
|735  |-null-|
|751  |pb    |
|751  |lake  |
|752  |roe   |
|752  |lake  |
|837  |roe   |
|837  |lake  |
|844  |roe   |
