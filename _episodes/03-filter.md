questions:
- "How can I select subsets of data?"
objectives:
- "Write queries that select records that satisfy user-specified conditions."
- "Explain the order in which the clauses in a query are executed."
keypoints:
- "Use WHERE to specify conditions that records must meet in order to be included in a query's results."
- "Use AND, OR, and NOT to combine tests."
- "Filtering is done on whole records, so conditions can use fields that are not actually displayed."
- "Write queries incrementally."

One of the most powerful features of a database is
the ability to [filter]({{ site.github.url }}/reference/#filter) data,
i.e.,
to select only those records that match certain criteria.
For example,
suppose we want to see when a particular site was visited.
We can select these records from the `Visited` table
by using a `WHERE` clause in our query:

~~~
SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE site='DR-1';
~~~
{: .sql}

|id   |site|dated     |
|-----|----|----------|
|619  |DR-1|1927-02-08|
|622  |DR-1|1927-02-10|
|844  |DR-1|1932-03-22|

The database manager executes this query in two stages.
First,
it checks at each row in the `Visited` table
to see which ones satisfy the `WHERE`.
It then uses the column names following the `SELECT` keyword
to determine which columns to display.

This processing order means that
we can filter records using `WHERE`
based on values in columns that aren't then displayed:

~~~
SELECT id FROM Visited WHERE site='DR-1';
~~~
{: .sql}

|id   |
|-----|
|619  |
|622  |
|844  |

![SQL Filtering in Action](../fig/sql-filter.svg)

We can use many other Boolean operators to filter our data.
For example,
we can ask for all information from the DR-1 site collected before 1930:

~~~
SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE site='DR-1' AND dated<'1930-01-01';
~~~
{: .sql}

|id   |site|dated     |
|-----|----|----------|
|619  |DR-1|1927-02-08|
|622  |DR-1|1927-02-10|

If we want to find out what measurements were taken by either Lake or Roerich,
we can combine the tests on their names using `OR`:

~~~
SELECT * FROM Survey WHERE person='lake' OR person='roe';
~~~
{: .sql}

|taken|person|quant|reading|
|-----|------|-----|-------|
|734  |lake  |sal  |0.05   |
|751  |lake  |sal  |0.1    |
|752  |lake  |rad  |2.19   |
|752  |lake  |sal  |0.09   |
|752  |lake  |temp |-16.0  |
|752  |roe   |sal  |41.6   |
|837  |lake  |rad  |1.46   |
|837  |lake  |sal  |0.21   |
|837  |roe   |sal  |22.5   |
|844  |roe   |rad  |11.25  |

Alternatively,
we can use `IN` to see if a value is in a specific set:

~~~
SELECT * FROM Survey WHERE person IN ('lake', 'roe');
~~~
{: .sql}

|taken|person|quant|reading|
|-----|------|-----|-------|
|734  |lake  |sal  |0.05   |
|751  |lake  |sal  |0.1    |
|752  |lake  |rad  |2.19   |
|752  |lake  |sal  |0.09   |
|752  |lake  |temp |-16.0  |
|752  |roe   |sal  |41.6   |
|837  |lake  |rad  |1.46   |
|837  |lake  |sal  |0.21   |
|837  |roe   |sal  |22.5   |
|844  |roe   |rad  |11.25  |

We can combine `AND` with `OR`,
but we need to be careful about which operator is executed first.
If we *don't* use parentheses,
we get this:

~~~
SELECT * FROM Survey WHERE quant='sal' AND person='lake' OR person='roe';
~~~
{: .sql}

|taken|person|quant|reading|
|-----|------|-----|-------|
|734  |lake  |sal  |0.05   |
|751  |lake  |sal  |0.1    |
|752  |lake  |sal  |0.09   |
|752  |roe   |sal  |41.6   |
|837  |lake  |sal  |0.21   |
|837  |roe   |sal  |22.5   |
|844  |roe   |rad  |11.25  |

which is salinity measurements by Lake,
and *any* measurement by Roerich.
We probably want this instead:

~~~
SELECT * FROM Survey WHERE quant='sal' AND (person='lake' OR person='roe');
~~~
{: .sql}

|taken|person|quant|reading|
|-----|------|-----|-------|
|734  |lake  |sal  |0.05   |
|751  |lake  |sal  |0.1    |
|752  |lake  |sal  |0.09   |
|752  |roe   |sal  |41.6   |
|837  |lake  |sal  |0.21   |
|837  |roe   |sal  |22.5   |

We can also filter by partial matches.  For example, if we want to
know something just about the site names beginning with "DR" we can
use the `LIKE` keyword.  The percent symbol acts as a
[wildcard]({{ site.github.url }}/reference/#wildcard), matching any characters in that
place.  It can be used at the beginning, middle, or end of the string:

~~~
SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE site LIKE 'DR%';
~~~
{: .sql}

|id   |site |dated     |
|-----|-----|----------|
|619  |DR-1 |1927-02-08|
|622  |DR-1 |1927-02-10|
|734  |DR-3 |1930-01-07|
|735  |DR-3 |1930-01-12|
|751  |DR-3 |1930-02-26|
|752  |DR-3 |          |
|844  |DR-1 |1932-03-22|


Finally,
we can use `DISTINCT` with `WHERE`
to give a second level of filtering:

~~~
SELECT DISTINCT person, quant FROM Survey WHERE person='lake' OR person='roe';
~~~
{: .sql}

|person|quant|
|------|-----|
|lake  |sal  |
|lake  |rad  |
|lake  |temp |
|roe   |sal  |
|roe   |rad  |

But remember:
`DISTINCT` is applied to the values displayed in the chosen columns,
not to the entire rows as they are being processed.
