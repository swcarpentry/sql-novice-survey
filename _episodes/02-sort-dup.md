title: "Sorting and Removing Duplicates"
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How can I sort a query's results?"
- "How can I remove duplicate values from a query's results?"
objectives:
- "Write queries that display results in a particular order."
- "Write queries that eliminate duplicate values from data."
keypoints:
- "The records in a database table are not intrinsically ordered: if we want to display them in some order, we must specify that explicitly with ORDER BY."
- "The values in a database are not guaranteed to be unique: if we want to eliminate duplicates, we must specify that explicitly as well using DISTINCT."

In beginning our examination of the Antarctic data, we want to know:

* what kind of quantity measurements were taken at each site;
* which scientists took measurements on the expedition;
* the sites where each scientist took measurements

To determine which measurements were taken at each site,
we can examine the `Survey` table.
Data is often redundant,
so queries often return redundant information.
For example,
if we select the quantities that have been measured
from the `Survey` table,
we get this:

~~~
SELECT quant FROM Survey;
~~~
{: .sql}

|quant|
|-----|
|rad  |
|sal  |
|rad  |
|sal  |
|rad  |
|sal  |
|temp |
|rad  |
|sal  |
|temp |
|rad  |
|temp |
|sal  |
|rad  |
|sal  |
|temp |
|sal  |
|rad  |
|sal  |
|sal  |
|rad  |

This result makes it difficult to see all of the different types of
`quant` in the Survey table.  We can eliminate the redundant output to
make the result more readable by adding the `DISTINCT` keyword to our
query:

~~~
SELECT DISTINCT quant FROM Survey;
~~~
{: .sql}

|quant|
|-----|
|rad  |
|sal  |
|temp |

If we want to determine which sites have which quant measurement,
we can use the `DISTINCT` keyword on multiple columns.
If we select more than one column,
the distinct *pairs* of values are returned:

~~~
SELECT DISTINCT taken, quant FROM Survey;
~~~
{: .sql}

|taken|quant|
|-----|-----|
|619  |rad  |
|619  |sal  |
|622  |rad  |
|622  |sal  |
|734  |rad  |
|734  |sal  |
|734  |temp |
|735  |rad  |
|735  |sal  |
|735  |temp |
|751  |rad  |
|751  |temp |
|751  |sal  |
|752  |rad  |
|752  |sal  |
|752  |temp |
|837  |rad  |
|837  |sal  |
|844  |rad  |

Notice in both cases that duplicates are removed
even if the rows they come from didn't appear to be adjacent in the database table.


Our next task is to identify the scientists on the expedition by looking at the `Person` table.
As we mentioned earlier,
database records are not stored in any particular order.
This means that query results aren't necessarily sorted,
and even if they are,
we often want to sort them in a different way,
e.g., by their identifier instead of by their personal name.
We can do this in SQL by adding an `ORDER BY` clause to our query:

~~~
SELECT * FROM Person ORDER BY id;
~~~
{: .sql}

|id     |personal |family  |
|-------|---------|--------|
|danfort|Frank    |Danforth|
|dyer   |William  |Dyer    |
|lake   |Anderson |Lake    |
|pb     |Frank    |Pabodie |
|roe    |Valentina|Roerich |

By default,
results are sorted in ascending order
(i.e.,
from least to greatest).
We can sort in the opposite order using `DESC` (for "descending"):

~~~
SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY id DESC;
~~~
{: .sql}

|id     |personal |family  |
|-------|---------|--------|
|roe    |Valentina|Roerich |
|pb     |Frank    |Pabodie |
|lake   |Anderson |Lake    |
|dyer   |William  |Dyer    |
|danfort|Frank    |Danforth|

(And if we want to make it clear that we're sorting in ascending order,
we can use `ASC` instead of `DESC`.)


In order to look at which scientist measured quantities at each site,
we can look again at the `Survey` table.
We can also sort on several fields at once.
For example,
this query sorts results first in ascending order by `taken`,
and then in descending order by `person`
within each group of equal `taken` values:

~~~
SELECT taken, person, quant FROM Survey ORDER BY taken ASC, person DESC;
~~~
{: .sql}

|taken|person|quant|
|-----|------|-----|
|619  |dyer  |rad  |
|619  |dyer  |sal  |
|622  |dyer  |rad  |
|622  |dyer  |sal  |
|734  |pb    |rad  |
|734  |pb    |temp |
|734  |lake  |sal  |
|735  |pb    |rad  |
|735  |-null-|sal  |
|735  |-null-|temp |
|751  |pb    |rad  |
|751  |pb    |temp |
|751  |lake  |sal  |
|752  |roe   |sal  |
|752  |lake  |rad  |
|752  |lake  |sal  |
|752  |lake  |temp |
|837  |roe   |sal  |
|837  |lake  |rad  |
|837  |lake  |sal  |
|844  |roe   |rad  |

This query gives us a good idea of which scientist was at which site,
and what measurements they performed while they were there.

Looking at the table, it seems like some scientists specialized in
certain kinds of measurements.  We can examine which scientists
performed which measurements by selecting the appropriate columns and
removing duplicates.

~~~
SELECT DISTINCT quant, person FROM Survey ORDER BY quant ASC;
~~~
{: .sql}

|quant|person|
|-----|------|
|rad  |dyer  |
|rad  |pb    |
|rad  |lake  |
|rad  |roe   |
|sal  |dyer  |
|sal  |lake  |
|sal  |-null-|
|sal  |roe   |
|temp |pb    |
|temp |-null-|
|temp |lake  |
