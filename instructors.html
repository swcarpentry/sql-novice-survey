<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>Relational databases are not as widely used in science as in business, but they are still a common way to store large data sets with complex structure. Even when the data itself isn’t in a database, the metadata could be: for example, meteorological data might be stored in files on disk, but data about when and where observations were made, data ranges, and so on could be in a database to make it easier for scientists to find what they want to.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first few sections (up to “Missing Data”) usually go very quickly. The pace usually slows down a bit when null values are discussed mostly because learners have a lot of details to keep straight by this point. Things <em>really</em> slow down during the discussion of joins, but this is the key idea in the whole lesson: important ideas like primary keys and referential integrity only make sense once learners have seen how they’re used in joins. It’s worth going over things a couple of times if necessary (with lots of examples).</p></li>
<li><p>The sections on creating and modifying data, and programming with databases, can be dropped if time is short. Of the two, people seem to care most about how to add data (which only takes a few minutes to demonstrate).</p></li>
<li><p>Simple calculations are actually easier to do in a spreadsheet; the advantages of using a database become clear as soon as filtering and joins are needed. Instructors may therefore want to show a spreadsheet with the information from the four database tables consolidated into a single sheet, and demonstrate what’s needed in both systems to answer questions like, “What was the average radiation reading in 1931?”</p></li>
<li>Some advanced learners may have heard that NoSQL databases (i.e., ones that don’t use the relational model) are the next big thing, and ask why we’re not teaching those. The answers are:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Relational databases are far more widely used than NoSQL databases.</li>
<li>We have far more experience with relational databases than with any other kind, so we have a better idea of what to teach and how to teach it.</li>
<li>NoSQL databases are as different from each other as they are from relational databases. Until a leader emerges, it isn’t clear <em>which</em> NoSQL database we should teach.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><span class="citation">@tomwright01</span>: 3 hours</li>
<li><span class="citation">@mckays630</span>: 3 hrs (up to Aggregation, using only shell interface)</li>
<li><span class="citation">@benwaugh</span>: 3 hours (rather rushed, touching only briefly on aggregation in order to leave 30 minutes for combining data)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>data/*.csv</code>: CSV versions of data in sample survey database.</li>
<li><code>tools/create-db.sql</code>: generate survey database used in examples based on CSV.</li>
<li><code>tools/sqlitemagic.py</code>: IPython Notebook plugin to handle SQLite databases.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sqlite-setup">SQLite Setup</h2>
<p>In order to execute the following lessons interactively, please install SQLite as mentioned in the setup instructions for your workshop. Then</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> clone http://github.com/swcarpentry/sql-novice-survey.git
$ <span class="kw">cd</span> sql-novice-survey</code></pre>
<p>Next, create the database that will be used.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">sqlite3</span> survey.db .read tools/create-db.sql</code></pre>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>The command history and line editing features provided by <code>readline</code> are invaluable with a command-line tool like <code>sqlite3</code>. Participants should be encouraged strongly to start with a simple SQL statement and then use the up-arrow key to go back and add clauses one at a time, or fix problems, rather than typing each command from scratch. Unfortunately on some Linux and Mac OSX systems participants have found that the arrow keys do not scroll through the command history as expected.</p>
<p>A workaround for this it to use the <a href="https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap">rlwrap</a> (readline wrapper) command when starting SQLite:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">rlwrap</span> sqlite3 survey.db</code></pre>
<p>Availability: the <code>rlwrap</code> package is available in the standard Fedora repository (but wasn’t needed when I <span class="citation">[@benwaugh]</span> taught this) and appears to be available in <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/rlwrap">Ubuntu</a> too, and in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5087790">OSX using Homebrew</a>.</p>
