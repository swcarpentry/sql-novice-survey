# Software
For this course you will need the UNIX shell, plus [SQLite3](http://www.sqlite.org/) or
[DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/).

If you are running Linux, you may already have SQLite3 installed, please use the command 
`which sqlite3` to see the path of the program, otherwise you should be able to get it 
from your package manager (on Debian/Ubuntu, you can use the command `apt install sqlite3`).

# Files
Please download the database we'll be using: [survey.db]({{ page.root }}/files/survey.db)
